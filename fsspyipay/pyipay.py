class Gateway:
    """A class that represents a payment gateway for hosted transactions, using the resource kit.

       The first step is to initialize the gateway by providing it the configuration received
       from the bank. This configuration consists of the following:

       - A resource file (called resource.cgn), which is an encrypted file that contains
         connection and credentials for the gateway.

       - A keystore file (called keystore.bin), which is a Java keystore that contains
         the encrption key which is used to decrypt the resource file.

       - The alias, which is a string. This is the friendly name of your terminal as
         setup by the bank. It it used to extract the correct configuration from the
         resource file.

       In addition to the above three values, you must also pass in the amount
       that you want to charge the customer for this transaction.

       :param str keystore: The file system path to the keystore file (normally called keystore.bin)
       :param str resource: The file system path to the resource file (normally called resource.cgn)
       :param str alias: The terminal alias that is to be used.
       :param float amount: The amount that needs to be charged. 3 decimal places by default for KWD.

       The following can be optionally specified, but are set to reasonable defaults:

       :param str lang: The language which will be used for the hosted pages to the end user. Values are 'en' (for English), and 'ar' for Arabic. The default is 'en'
       :param str currency: The ISO currency code. Defaults to 'KWD'. If you change this, make sure the terminal supports the currency.
       :param str tracking_id: This is a unique id for each transaction that is required by the gateway. If not supplied, the current timestamp is used.

       Once you have created an instance of the Gateway, you can specify further configuration. There are two pieces of information that are
       critical, the response url and the error url.

       These urls cannot have any query strings or fragments; and must be publicly accessible as this is where the gateway will return the results
       of the transactions.

       Finally, you request the redirect url from the module; which is where you should redirect the customer to start the payment process.

       The example provides details on how this all works:

       :Example:

       >>> from fsspyipay import Gateway
       >>> resource_file = r'/home/me/resource.cgn'
       >>> keystore_file = r'/home/me/keystore.bin'
       >>> gw = Gateway(keystore_file, resource_file, 'alias', 4.546)
       >>> gw.response_url = 'https://example.com/response'
       >>> gw.error_url = 'https://example.com/error'
       >>> url = gw.generate_purchase_request()
